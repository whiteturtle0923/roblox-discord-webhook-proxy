# Discord Webhook Proxy
###### (WIP), only supports 1 webhook

**Currently used for Modern RTS on roblox**

By default roblox doesn't allow you to use an http request for discord webhooks. This proxy fixes that!

Using simple javascript, when you send an http request from roblox to this proxy, it sends it to discord!
